Tile based game

Made in C++ with SDL2

However my knowledge of both of these is pretty bad

Learning about 3D rendering
Isometric view

View angle is subjective, still need to remake own linked list and hash map

Plan to create some strategy game, details still uncertain

Currently just using to try to have fun designing specific aspects of the game, not trying too much to complete the game quickly

Possibly expanding upon previous hackathon project
